## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project


This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

* Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
* UnZip the file
* Loads both the training and test datasets
* Load the activity and feature info
* Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
* Merges the two datasets
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
